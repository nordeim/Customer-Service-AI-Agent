- **Focus Areas**: Backend, AI/ML, Data Architecture, Infrastructure, Monitoring

#### C. Data Model Compliance
- **Objective**: Validate CLAUDE.md database references align with schema v4.sql
- **Method**: Schema element mapping and constraint verification
- **Focus Areas**: Table structures, custom types, indexes, RLS policies, partitions

#### D. Implementation Phase Alignment
- **Objective**: Confirm CLAUDE.md implementation status matches Coding Plan v3
- **Method**: Phase-by-phase completion verification
- **Focus Areas**: Current status, next phases, file structures, success criteria

#### E. Functional Requirements Coverage
- **Objective**: Verify all PRD v4 functional requirements are addressed
- **Method**: Requirements traceability matrix
- **Focus Areas**: Conversation lifecycle, multi-channel, NLP, response generation, Salesforce tech, KB, rules, escalation, proactive intelligence, analytics

#### F. Non-Functional Requirements Validation
- **Objective**: Ensure performance, security, compliance requirements are captured
- **Method**: NFR checklist validation
- **Focus Areas**: Performance SLAs, availability, security, compliance, usability

### 3.2 Review Process Steps

#### Phase 1: Baseline Establishment (Day 1)
1. Extract authoritative statements from each document
2. Create requirement traceability matrix
3. Document current CLAUDE.md baseline
4. Identify review focus areas

#### Phase 2: Alignment Analysis (Day 2-3)
1. Mission statement comparison (PRD v4 vs CLAUDE.md)
2. Technology stack verification (Solution Blueprint vs CLAUDE.md)
3. Data model compliance check (Schema v4 vs CLAUDE.md)
4. Implementation status validation (Coding Plan vs CLAUDE.md)
5. Functional requirements coverage assessment
6. Non-functional requirements validation

#### Phase 3: Gap Identification (Day 4)
1. Categorize alignment gaps by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
