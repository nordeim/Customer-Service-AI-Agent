# Frontend - Customer Service AI

Small Vite + React + TypeScript scaffold for Phase 8 UI work.

Quick start (requires Node.js and npm):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

This scaffold includes:
- basic routing (Chat, Admin, Analytics)
- i18n initialization with English locale
- Tailwind-ready config
Notes:
- Backend integration points use `/api` proxy; adjust `vite.config.ts` or set `VITE_API_BASE` in `.env` if needed.
- This is a minimal, self-contained starter for Phase 8 work.

Useful commands:

```bash
# install deps
npm install

# run dev server
npm run dev

# lint
npm run lint

# run tests
npm run test

# run coverage
npm run test:coverage
```
