‚óè üéâ Phase 6 Implementation Complete!

  I have successfully implemented the complete Conversation Engine for the AI Customer Service Agent for Salesforce project according to Phase 6 of the Coding Execution Plan v3. Here's a comprehensive summary:

  ‚úÖ Core Components Implemented

  1. 9-State Conversation State Machine (state_machine.py)
    - All 9 states: initialized, active, waiting_for_user, waiting_for_agent, processing, escalated, transferred, resolved, abandoned, archived
    - Comprehensive transition rules with validation
    - State-specific timeout management and auto-transitions
    - Escalation and resolution validation with required metadata
  2. Multi-layered Context Manager (context.py)
    - User Context: Organization isolation, user profiles, permissions
    - Session Context: Conversation lifecycle, state tracking, activity timestamps
    - AI Context: Intent history, emotion tracking, sentiment analysis, entity extraction
    - Business Context: SLA tracking, escalation triggers, business rules
    - Thread-safe context management with cleanup
  3. Message Processing Pipeline (message_processor.py)
    - Parallel processing of language detection, intent classification, sentiment analysis, emotion detection, entity extraction
    - Integration with Phase 5 AI orchestrator
    - Configurable processing with fallback mechanisms
    - Performance optimization with caching
  4. Emotion-Aware Response System (emotion_handler.py)
    - 7 emotion types: angry, frustrated, confused, neutral, satisfied, happy, excited
    - Dynamic tone adaptation based on detected emotions
    - Escalation thresholds for high-intensity emotions
    - Empathetic response strategies
  5. Intent-Specific Handlers (intent_handler.py)
    - Pluggable architecture for technical support, account management, billing, escalation requests
    - Context-aware intent processing
    - Business rule integration
    - Extensible handler framework
  6. Conversation Analytics (analytics.py)
    - Real-time metrics: active conversations, message counts, processing times
    - AI performance tracking: confidence scores, model usage, token consumption
    - SLA monitoring and breach detection
    - Historical reporting and trend analysis
  7. Main Conversation Manager (manager.py)
    - Central orchestrator integrating all components
    - State management and transition validation
    - Message routing and response generation
    - Escalation handling and conversation closure
  8. Response Generator (response_generator.py)
    - Template-based response generation
    - Context-aware variable substitution
    - Multi-channel formatting (web, mobile, email, chat)
    - Quick reply suggestions

  ‚úÖ Key Features Validated

  - Complete Conversation Lifecycle: Creation ‚Üí Message Processing ‚Üí State Transitions ‚Üí Escalation ‚Üí Resolution ‚Üí Analytics
