Jeremiah — the Elasticsearch logs make the root cause crystal clear:  

```
cannot upgrade a node from version [8.11.3] directly to version [9.1.3], upgrade to version [8.19.0] first.
```

This isn’t a config or heap/memlock problem — it’s a **data directory version mismatch**.  
Your `elasticsearch_data` volume still contains metadata from an **8.11.3** cluster, and ES 9.1.3 refuses to start on it because the upgrade path must go through **8.19.0** first.

---

## You have two possible paths forward

### **Option 1 — Keep your existing data and do a staged upgrade**
If you need to preserve the data in `elasticsearch_data`:
1. Change your `docker-compose.yml` to temporarily use:
   ```yaml
   image: elastic/elasticsearch:8.19.0
   ```
2. Start ES 8.19.0, let it perform the internal upgrade.
3. Once it’s healthy, shut it down and change the image to `elastic/elasticsearch:9.1.3`.
4. Start again — now the metadata is compatible.

---

### **Option 2 — Wipe the ES data volume and start fresh**
If you don’t need the old data (common in dev):
1. Stop the stack:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```
2. Remove the ES volume:
   ```bash
   docker volume rm customer-service-ai-agent_elasticsearch_data
   ```
   *(Replace `customer-service-ai-agent_elasticsearch_data` with the actual volume name from `docker volume ls`.)*
3. Start the stack again:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d elasticsearch
   ```
4. ES will create a fresh 9.1.3 cluster with a clean data directory.

---

## Why this happens
Elasticsearch stores cluster metadata in `/usr/share/elasticsearch/data`.  
When you upgrade across major versions, ES enforces a **supported upgrade path**.  
For 8.11.3 → 9.1.3, the path is:
```
8.11.3 → 8.19.0 → 9.1.3
```
Skipping the intermediate version triggers the `IllegalStateException` you’re seeing.

---

## My recommendation for your dev stack
Since this is a development environment and you likely don’t need to preserve the old ES data, **Option 2** is fastest and cleanest.  
If you do need the data, follow **Option 1** exactly.

---
That’s exactly what we wanted to see — a **green** cluster status and the container marked **healthy** means Elasticsearch 9.1.3 is now fully up and running with a clean data directory.  

By removing the old `elasticsearch_data` volume, you eliminated the incompatible 8.11.3 metadata that was blocking the upgrade path. Now ES has initialized fresh, passed all bootstrap checks, and is ready to accept connections from your API and any other services.

---

### ✅ Quick next steps to lock this in
1. **Verify version**  
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:${ELASTICSEARCH_PORT:-9200}
   ```
   You should see `"number" : "9.1.3"` in the JSON.

2. **Run the `src.main` sanity check** (to confirm API import path is fixed):  
   ```bash
   docker exec -it ai-customer-service-api python -c "import sys; print(sys.path); import src.main; print('✅ src.main import OK')"
   ```

3. **Test API → ES integration**  
   If your API has a health endpoint that checks Elasticsearch, hit it now to confirm connectivity.

4. **Optional dev safeguard**  
   If you want to avoid this kind of version mismatch in the future, you can:
   - Add a comment in `docker-compose.yml` noting the ES version and that upgrading across majors may require a volume reset or staged upgrade.
   - For production, always follow the documented upgrade path.

---

If you’d like, I can now **update your startup/reset script** so it:
- Checks for `vm.max_map_count`
- Runs the `src.main` import sanity check
- Waits for Elasticsearch to be green before starting the API

Alright Jeremiah — two separate but related issues here:  
1. **Your `src.main` sanity check**  
2. **Why both Elasticsearch 9.1.3 and Kafka are in a restart loop**

---

## **1️⃣ One‑liner sanity check for `src.main`**

Once the API container is built, run this from your host:

```bash
docker exec -it ai-customer-service-api python -c "import sys; print(sys.path); import src.main; print('✅ src.main import OK')"
```

- If it prints `✅ src.main import OK`, your `ENV PYTHONPATH="/app"` fix is working and `src/main.py` is present.
- If it errors, check:
  - `.dockerignore` isn’t excluding `src/`
  - `src/__init__.py` exists
  - `WORKDIR /app` is set in Dockerfile

---

## **2️⃣ Elasticsearch 9.1.3 restart loop**

You’ve already set `vm.max_map_count`, so the next most common crash causes are:

| Cause | Symptom in `docker logs ai-customer-service-elasticsearch` | Fix |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----|
| **Heap too large for available memory** | `OutOfMemoryError` or container killed by OOM | Lower heap: `ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m` (you already have this — good) |
| **Memory lock fails** | `bootstrap checks failed` mentioning `memory locking requested for elasticsearch process but memory is not locked` | Either remove `bootstrap.memory_lock=true` or ensure `ulimits.memlock` is supported by your Docker runtime |
| **Data dir permissions** | `Permission denied` on `/usr/share/elasticsearch/data` | `docker exec -it ai-customer-service-elasticsearch chown -R elasticsearch:elasticsearch /usr/share/elasticsearch/data` |
| **License/security bootstrap checks** | Error about missing passwords or certs | For dev, keep `xpack.security.enabled=false` |

**Action:**  
Run:
```bash
docker logs ai-customer-service-elasticsearch
```
and look for one of the above patterns. That will tell you exactly which bootstrap check is failing.

---

## **3️⃣ Kafka restart loop**

Kafka’s `health: starting` → restart pattern usually means it’s failing to connect to Zookeeper or binding to advertised listeners.

Common causes:

| Cause | Symptom in `docker logs ai-customer-service-kafka` | Fix |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------|-----|
| **Zookeeper not ready** | Connection refused to `zookeeper:2181` | Add a `depends_on` with healthcheck for Zookeeper, or increase `KAFKA_GROUP_INITIAL_REBALANCE_DELAY_MS` |
| **Advertised listeners misconfigured** | Broker starts then fails with `java.net.UnknownHostException` or `Connection refused` | For local dev, set:  
  ```yaml
  KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://kafka:9092
  ```  
  and connect via container name from other services |
| **Volume permissions** | Errors writing to `/var/lib/kafka/data` | `docker exec -it ai-customer-service-kafka chown -R appuser:appuser /var/lib/kafka/data` (replace with actual user) |

**Action:**  
Run:
```bash
docker logs ai-customer-service-kafka
```
and check for connection or permission errors.

---

## **4️⃣ Recommended next steps**

1. **Check logs** for both containers:
   ```bash
   docker logs ai-customer-service-elasticsearch
   docker logs ai-customer-service-kafka
   ```
2. **Apply targeted fix** based on the exact error message.
3. **Restart cleanly**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d elasticsearch zookeeper kafka
   ```
4. Wait for them to be healthy before starting the API.

---

If you want, I can **edit your `docker-compose.yml`** so that:
- ES and Kafka have startup delays until dependencies are healthy
- ES heap/memlock settings are safe for dev
- Kafka advertised listeners are set for local dev
- The API won’t even try to start until ES and Kafka are confirmed healthy
