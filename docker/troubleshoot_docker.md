Here’s the **one‑line Dockerfile patch** you can drop right after your `WORKDIR /app` line to guarantee `src` is always importable:  

```dockerfile
ENV PYTHONPATH="/app"
```  

That ensures `/app` is on `sys.path` inside the container, so `uvicorn src.main:app` will resolve regardless of how the container is started.

---

### Quick `.dockerignore` check for `src/main.py`

Run this from your repo root:

```bash
grep -E '(^src$|^src/|^/src)' .dockerignore || echo "✅ src/ not excluded"
```

- If it prints a matching line, your `.dockerignore` is excluding `src` (or its contents) — remove or adjust that line so `src/main.py` is copied into the image.
- If it prints `✅ src/ not excluded`, you’re safe.

---

**Pro tip:** after adding the `ENV PYTHONPATH="/app"` line and confirming `.dockerignore` is clean, rebuild without cache to make sure the fix takes effect:

```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache api
docker-compose up -d api
```

Do you want me to also give you a **tiny test command** you can run inside the container to confirm `src.main` imports cleanly before starting Uvicorn? That’s a nice sanity check before redeploying.

that error is actually very telling.  
It means **Uvicorn can’t find or import your `src.main` module inside the container**. This is not about FastAPI itself — it’s purely a Python import path problem.

---

## Why this happens in Docker

Inside your `Dockerfile` you have:

```dockerfile
WORKDIR /app
COPY --chown=aiagent:aiagent src/ ./src/
...
CMD ["uvicorn", "src.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

That means:

- At runtime, Python’s working directory is `/app`.
- `/app/src` **should** contain `main.py`.
- For `uvicorn src.main:app` to work, `/app` must be on `PYTHONPATH` so that `src` is treated as a package.

If `src` isn’t on the import path, or `main.py` isn’t actually there in the container, you’ll get exactly this error.

---

## Step 1 — Confirm the file exists in the container

Run:

```bash
docker exec -it ai-customer-service-api ls -R /app/src
```

You should see `main.py` in there.  
If you don’t, the COPY step in your Dockerfile isn’t bringing it in — maybe `.dockerignore` is excluding it.

---

## Step 2 — Confirm Python can import it

Run:

```bash
docker exec -it ai-customer-service-api python -c "import sys; print(sys.path); import src.main"
```

If that import fails, it’s a `PYTHONPATH` issue.

---

## Step 3 — Fixes

### **Option A — Ensure `src` is copied and on the path**
Add this to your Dockerfile after `WORKDIR /app`:

```dockerfile
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app
```

This guarantees `/app` is in the import path, so `src.main` resolves.

---

### **Option B — Change the Uvicorn command**
If you don’t want to set `PYTHONPATH`, you can run Uvicorn from inside the `src` directory:

```dockerfile
WORKDIR /app/src
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

But this changes relative paths for other parts of your app, so Option A is cleaner.

---

### **Option C — Make `src` a package**
Ensure there’s an empty `__init__.py` file in `src/`.  
Without it, Python 3.12’s stricter import rules can sometimes fail to treat `src` as a package in certain contexts.

---

## Step 4 — Rebuild and test

After applying the fix:

```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache api
docker-compose up -d api
docker logs -f ai-customer-service-api
```

You should see Uvicorn start without the “Could not import module” error.

---

## My recommendation for you

Given your current structure and the fact you mount `./src:/app/src` in Compose for dev, the **most robust fix** is:

1. Add `ENV PYTHONPATH=/app` to the Dockerfile.
2. Ensure `src/__init__.py` exists.
3. Keep `CMD ["uvicorn", "src.main:app", ...]` as-is.

That way:
- Works in Docker and locally.
- Keeps your project root as `/app`.
- No surprises with relative imports.

---

If you want, I can give you a **one-line Dockerfile patch** that adds `PYTHONPATH` and a **quick `.dockerignore` check** to make sure `src/main.py` isn’t being excluded. That will make this bulletproof.  



---
the fact that your `api` container is in a **Restarting (1)** loop means the container process is exiting with a non‑zero status almost immediately after starting. Since your build is fully cached and completed without errors, this is **not** a build‑time problem — it’s a **runtime crash** inside the container.

Let’s break this down methodically.

---

## 1️⃣ What the logs are telling us

- **Restarting (1)** means the container’s main process (in your case `uvicorn src.main:app …`) exited with code `1`.
- Docker Compose’s `depends_on` and healthcheck waiting won’t help if the process itself crashes before it can even respond to health probes.
- The warnings about `PINECONE_API_KEY`, `DATADOG_API_KEY`, etc. being unset are **not fatal** by themselves — they’re just Compose telling you it’s substituting an empty string.  
  However, if your application code **expects** these to be set and fails hard when they’re missing, that would explain the crash.

---

## 2️⃣ Immediate next step — get the real error

Run:

```bash
docker logs ai-customer-service-api
```

This will show the stdout/stderr from `uvicorn` and your app.  
If the container is restarting quickly, you might want to follow logs live:

```bash
docker logs -f ai-customer-service-api
```

Look for:
- Python tracebacks
- Import errors (e.g., missing module)
- Runtime exceptions from your startup code (e.g., in `src/main.py` or FastAPI startup events)
- Connection errors to dependencies (Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch, etc.)

---

## 3️⃣ Common causes in your setup

Based on your config and recent changes:

### **A. Missing required env vars**
If your code does something like:
```python
pinecone.init(api_key=os.environ["PINECONE_API_KEY"])
```
…then an empty string will cause an exception at startup.  
**Fix:** Either set these in `.env` / Compose, or make your code handle missing keys gracefully.

---

### **B. Dependency version mismatch**
You just bumped:
- `elasticsearch` Python client to 9.1.3
- Elasticsearch container to 9.1.3

If your code uses APIs that changed between 8.x and 9.x, it could crash on import or client init.  
**Fix:** Check logs for `TypeError` / `AttributeError` in ES client code.

---

### **C. Python 3.12 upgrade fallout**
Some packages (especially C‑extensions like `torch`, `spacy`, `pandas`) may import fine but fail at runtime if compiled against older ABI.  
**Fix:** If logs show `ImportError: cannot import name ...`, rebuild without cache:
```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache api
```

---

### **D. Healthcheck vs. startup timing**
If your app tries to connect to Elasticsearch 9.1.3 before it’s ready, and you don’t catch the exception, the process will exit.  
**Fix:** Wrap startup connections in retry logic.

---

## 4️⃣ How I’d debug this in your stack

1. **Get logs**:
   ```bash
   docker logs ai-customer-service-api
   ```
2. **Run interactively** to see crash in real time:
   ```bash
   docker-compose run --rm api uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   ```
3. **Temporarily disable healthcheck** in Compose for `api` to prevent restarts while debugging.
4. **Set dummy env vars** in `.env` to rule out missing key crashes:
   ```env
   PINECONE_API_KEY=dummy
   PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=dummy
   DATADOG_API_KEY=dummy
   PAGERDUTY_INTEGRATION_KEY=dummy
   ```
5. **If it’s a dependency import error**, rebuild with `--no-cache` to ensure wheels are for Python 3.12.

---

## 5️⃣ Likely quick fix

Given the warnings and your stack, my top suspicion is **startup code failing due to missing env vars**.  
You can test this hypothesis fast:

```bash
export PINECONE_API_KEY=dummy
export PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=dummy
export DATADOG_API_KEY=dummy
export PAGERDUTY_INTEGRATION_KEY=dummy
docker-compose up -d --build api
```

If it stays up, you’ve confirmed the cause.

---

✅ **Next step for you:**  
Run `docker logs ai-customer-service-api` and share the traceback — I can then pinpoint whether it’s env vars, dependency mismatch, or Python 3.12 fallout, and give you the exact code/config change to fix it.

---

Do you want me to **update your docker-compose.yml** so that it sets safe default values for these env vars to prevent restarts during local dev? That would let the container start even if you haven’t configured the real keys yet.
