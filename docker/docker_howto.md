Right now, the safe reset script I gave you **stops, optionally wipes volumes, rebuilds, and brings the whole stack up in one go** — it doesn’t yet split the startup into a **“bring up infra → wait for healthy → bring up API → run migrations”** sequence like you outlined.  

That sequence is actually the more robust approach for your architecture, because:  
- Your `api` service depends on multiple databases and brokers being healthy before it can start cleanly.  
- Even though you’ve got `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy`, Compose doesn’t wait for *all* healthchecks before starting the API unless you explicitly control the order.  
- Running migrations after infra is up ensures schema is in place before the API starts serving requests.  

---

## Updated Safe Reset Script (Infra → API → Migrations)

Here’s a refined version that covers exactly what you described:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Stopping containers..."
docker-compose down

read -p "Remove ALL volumes? This will delete ALL persisted data (y/N): " confirm
if [[ "$confirm" =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    echo "Removing all volumes..."
    docker-compose down --volumes
else
    echo "Skipping volume removal."
fi

echo "Rebuilding images..."
docker-compose build --no-cache

echo "Starting infrastructure services..."
docker-compose up --build -d postgres redis elasticsearch neo4j mongodb zookeeper kafka

echo "Waiting for services to become healthy..."
# Loop until all infra services are healthy
services=(postgres redis elasticsearch neo4j mongodb kafka)
for service in "${services[@]}"; do
    echo "Waiting for $service..."
    until [ "$(docker inspect --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}' ai-customer-service-$service)" == "healthy" ]; do
        sleep 3
    done
done

echo "Starting API service..."
docker-compose up --build -d api

echo "Waiting for API to become healthy..."
until [ "$(docker inspect --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}' ai-customer-service-api)" == "healthy" ]; do
    sleep 3
done

echo "Running database migrations..."
docker-compose exec api alembic upgrade head

echo "✅ Environment reset and ready."
```

---

### Why this is better for your stack
- **Explicit infra-first startup** — avoids API boot failures due to race conditions.
- **Healthcheck-based waits** — uses the healthchecks you already defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Controlled migrations** — ensures schema is applied before API starts serving traffic.
- **Optional destructive reset** — keeps you from accidentally nuking production-like data.

Here’s the deep-dive on why your  

```bash
docker-compose down --volumes postgres
```  

failed, and how to handle teardown cleanly for this stack.

---

## 1️⃣ Why your command failed

The `down` subcommand’s `--volumes` flag is **boolean only** — it removes **all** named and anonymous volumes for services in the Compose file. It does **not** accept a specific volume name as an argument.  

So when you wrote:

```bash
docker-compose down --volumes postgres
```

Compose interpreted `postgres` as an **extra positional argument** (invalid), so it printed the usage help.

---

## 2️⃣ How to remove **only** Postgres data

Your Postgres service uses:

```yaml
volumes:
  - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```

…and in the `volumes:` section:

```yaml
postgres_data:
  driver: local
```

Docker will name that volume:

```
<project_name>_postgres_data
```

where `<project_name>` defaults to the folder name unless you override with `-p`.

**Steps to remove just that volume:**

```bash
# Stop containers but keep volumes
docker-compose down

# Find the actual volume name
docker volume ls | grep postgres_data

# Remove it
docker volume rm <project_name>_postgres_data
```

---

## 3️⃣ How to remove **all** volumes (full reset)

If you want a clean slate for **every** service’s data:

```bash
docker-compose down --volumes
```

This will remove:
- `postgres_data`
- `redis_data`
- `elasticsearch_data`
- `neo4j_data`
- `neo4j_logs`
- `mongodb_data`
- `kafka_data`

⚠ **Note:** This is destructive — all persisted data will be gone.

---

## 4️⃣ Safe teardown/rebuild workflow for your stack

Given your multi-service architecture, here’s a **safe reset script** that avoids accidental data loss unless explicitly requested:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Stopping containers..."
docker-compose down

read -p "Remove ALL volumes? This will delete ALL persisted data (y/N): " confirm
if [[ "$confirm" =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    echo "Removing all volumes..."
    docker-compose down --volumes
else
    echo "Skipping volume removal."
fi

echo "Rebuilding images..."
docker-compose build --no-cache

echo "Starting stack..."
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## 5️⃣ Dockerfile & Compose observations

Your `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` are generally **production-grade**, but here are a few refinements:

- **Dockerfile**
  - ✅ Multi-stage build is clean and keeps runtime image slim.
  - Consider adding `--no-cache-dir` to `pip install` in the builder stage (you already set `PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=1`, so you’re good).
  - The healthcheck uses `requests` — ensure it’s in `requirements.txt` so it’s installed in the venv.
  - You might want to `COPY requirements.txt` into the final image for debugging dependency versions.

- **docker-compose.yml**
  - All volumes are **internal** (not `external`), so `--volumes` will remove them — no surprises.
  - Healthchecks are well-defined; `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy` is a good touch.
  - For Postgres, you’re mounting `.sql` files into `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` — these only run on **first init** (empty volume). If you reset only the container but not the volume, they won’t re-run.

---

## 6️⃣ TL;DR Fix

- To remove **all** volumes:  
  ```bash
  docker-compose down --volumes
  ```
- To remove **only Postgres data**:  
  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  docker volume rm <project_name>_postgres_data
  ```

---

If you want, I can also give you a **one-liner** that stops the stack and removes **only** the Postgres volume without touching the others — useful for schema resets without nuking Redis, Kafka, etc.  

Do you want me to prepare that next?

---
The key issue is here:  

```bash
docker-compose down --volumes postgres
```

`docker-compose down` **does not** accept a volume name after `--volumes`.  
The `--volumes` flag is a boolean switch — it removes **all** named volumes declared in the `volumes` section of your `docker-compose.yml` and any anonymous volumes attached to containers. It doesn’t take an argument like `postgres`.  

That’s why it’s showing you the usage help instead of actually stopping/removing the container.  

---

### Correct ways to achieve what you probably intended

#### 1. **Stop and remove everything (including volumes)**
```bash
docker-compose down --volumes
```
This will:
- Stop all containers defined in the Compose file
- Remove them
- Remove all associated named and anonymous volumes

---

#### 2. **Remove only a specific volume**
If you only want to remove the `postgres` volume without touching others:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker volume rm <volume_name>
```
You can find the exact volume name with:
```bash
docker volume ls
```
If your `docker-compose.yml` defines it as:
```yaml
volumes:
  postgres:
```
then the actual Docker volume name will usually be:
```
<project_name>_postgres
```
where `<project_name>` is derived from the folder name or `-p` flag.

---

#### 3. **Remove and rebuild from scratch**
If you want a clean slate for Postgres:
```bash
docker-compose down --volumes --rmi local
docker-compose up --build
```
This removes containers, volumes, and any locally built images.

---

If you want, I can also give you a **safe teardown/rebuild script** that avoids accidental data loss but still resets your environment cleanly.  

Do you want me to prepare that alongside the `Dockerfile` review?
