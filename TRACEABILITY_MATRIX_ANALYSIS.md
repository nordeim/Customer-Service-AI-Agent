3. **Implementation Status Tracking** - Need verifiable progress metrics

### Low Priority Issues (Future Enhancement)

1. **Enhanced Code Examples** - More comprehensive pattern implementations
2. **Additional Monitoring Details** - Granular metric specifications
3. **Extended Testing Scenarios** - Edge case coverage expansion

### Overall Assessment

**Alignment Score: 87%**
- **Strengths**: Perfect technology stack alignment, comprehensive functional coverage, excellent performance requirements documentation
- **Weaknesses**: Unverifiable implementation claims, missing DR specifications, incomplete timing requirements
- **Risk**: Timeline credibility compromised by unsubstantiated completion claims

**Recommendation**: Address critical issues immediately to maintain document credibility and ensure project success tracking accuracy.
