Jeremiah — great catch. The build failed because one or more pins in your requirements are incompatible with Python 3.11. The smoking gun is:

- ERROR: Ignored versions require Python <3.11 … No matching distribution found for imap-tools==1.5.2

imap-tools 1.5.2 doesn’t ship wheels for Python 3.11 (it supports <3.11). That’s why the API image fails in the builder stage.

## Direct fixes

You’ve got three clean paths. Pick one:

1) Keep Python 3.11, upgrade imap-tools
- Change the pin:
  - imap-tools>=1.11.0,<2.0 (or latest stable known-good for your codebase)
- Rebuild:
  - docker-compose build api --no-cache
  - docker-compose up -d api

2) Keep imap-tools==1.5.2, downgrade Python to 3.10
- In both stages of Dockerfile:
  - FROM python:3.10-slim
- Rebuild:
  - docker-compose build api --no-cache
  - docker-compose up -d api

3) Use environment markers (supports mixed dev fleets)
- In requirements.txt:
  - imap-tools==1.5.2; python_version < "3.11"
  - imap-tools>=1.11,<2.0; python_version >= "3.11"
- Rebuild:
  - docker-compose build api --no-cache
  - docker-compose up -d api

If you want me to choose: I recommend option 1 (upgrade imap-tools) to keep Python 3.11 and avoid maintaining divergent environments.

## Additional hardening to avoid future builder failures

- Prefer binary wheels where possible:
  - In Dockerfile builder stage, change the install line to:
    - pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
    - pip install --prefer-binary -r /tmp/requirements.txt
- Ensure healthcheck dependency exists:
  - Your Dockerfile healthcheck imports requests. Make sure requests is in requirements.txt or switch healthcheck to curl (already installed in runtime):
    - HEALTHCHECK … CMD curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/health || exit 1
- Torch runtime dependency (optional safeguard):
  - Add libgomp1 to the runtime stage to avoid rare runtime errors with some wheels:
    - apt-get install -y … libgomp1
  - You already have libstdc++6 via base image; most PyTorch wheels will just work.

## Updated reset workflow with the fix applied

Once you update the dependency pins (or base Python version):

- Bring up infra:
  - docker-compose up --build -d postgres redis elasticsearch neo4j mongodb zookeeper kafka
- Wait for health (your compose healthchecks cover all but zookeeper):
  - Watch: docker-compose ps
- Bring up API:
  - docker-compose up --build -d api
- Run migrations:
  - docker-compose exec api alembic upgrade head

If you want, I’ll update the script to:
- Fail fast if pip install fails (it already does)
- Print a friendly hint when it detects imap-tools pin incompatible with the current Python
- Offer a --python=3.10 flag to use an alternate Dockerfile variant on-demand

## What I need to review precisely

To give you a bulletproof, version-accurate fix without guessing, please share:
- requirements.txt (exact pins matter here)
- Any constraints file (constraints.txt) if you use one
- Optional: pyproject.toml/poetry.lock if you manage deps via Poetry

I won’t assume content; I’ll align the compatibility matrix with Python 3.11 and flag any other pins likely to break on slim images.

Want me to produce a patched requirements snippet plus a ready-to-drop-in healthcheck tweak once you share the requirements.txt?
