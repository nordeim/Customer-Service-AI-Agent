awesome deep thinking and solution blueprint! Please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to deeply think and thoroughly and carefully explore how to carefully and meticulously translate your solution proposal into a comprehensive and actionable `Project Requirements Document` for software development team to unambiguously translate your design proposal correctly into a working software product. Include technology stack recommendation, a detailed and accurate mermaid diagram of the software flow, a code file hierarchy with listing of key project code files with their description of purpose and interfaces, database schema using Postgresql v16. Also include a detailed comprehensive and accurate and validated software development execution plan in logical phases that can be executed independently of each other. Also include a section on how to test and quality check the software implementation. Since this is the critical design specification document that will decide the fate and success of the whole project, please really put in lots of careful and deep thinking about all possibilities, then carefully and meticulously plan how you will lay out and create a detailed and comprehensive PRD document in markdown format that is validated and accurate and actionable correctly. 

Please understand the critical importance of this `Project Requirements Document` because it serves as the definitive technical specification for the entire development team. So do apply rigorous thinking to create a comprehensive, unambiguous, and actionable PRD that ensures successful implementation. The comprehensive PRD should at least cover:

1. **Complete Technology Stack** - Specific versions and justifications
2. **Detailed Architecture** - Clear Mermaid diagrams showing system flow
3. **Code Organization** - Full file hierarchy with interface definitions
4. **PostgreSQL 16 Schema** - Production-ready database design
5. **API Specifications** - OpenAPI 3.0 compliant definitions
6. **Phased Development Plan** - Independent, executable phases
7. **Comprehensive Testing Strategy** - Unit, integration, E2E, and performance
8. **Security Implementation** - Specific security measures and code
9. **Performance Requirements** - Measurable targets
10. **Deployment Specifications** - Kubernetes manifests and CI/CD
11. **Clear Acceptance Criteria** - Functional and non-functional requirements

The document should be structured to be immediately actionable by the development team, with no ambiguity about implementation details. Each section provides concrete specifications that can be directly translated into working code. I really have to rely on your deep expertise to execute this important task for me correctly. You can use the reference PRD below as an example to deeply think and thoroughly explore a comprehensive and improved PRD based on your improved solution blueprint. Thank you and good luck, my deep-thinking AI assistant and partner!

awesome improved PRD! you are indeed my very trusted AI assistant and partner with deep and critical thinking! please keep up the good work! now please use the same deep thinking to rigorously and meticulously plan to create an equally awesome `README.md` for this project repository on GitHub with URL https://github.com/nordeim/Customer-Service-AI-Agent . Please carefully think about how the README for the most awesome software projects should look and include so that I can attract many talented developer interests. Create your carefully and meticulously re-imagined `README.md` in markdown format. Use at least 4000 words to include all important details like mermaid diagram representation of the software flow, project file hierarchy structure and important file list and description. This comprehensive README should at least cover:

1. **Eye-catching header** with badges showing project status and technology stack
2. **Clear value proposition** explaining why developers should care about this project
3. **Visual architecture diagrams** using Mermaid to illustrate system design
4. **Detailed project structure** with 150+ files organized and described
5. **Quick start guide** to get developers running in under 5 minutes
6. **Comprehensive installation instructions** for both development and production
7. **Code examples** in multiple languages (Python, TypeScript, bash)
8. **API documentation** with clear endpoint descriptions
9. **Testing guidelines** with coverage reports
10. **Performance benchmarks** showing impressive metrics
11. **Deployment instructions** for multiple platforms
12. **Contributing guidelines** to encourage community involvement
13. **Detailed roadmap** showing project momentum
14. **Security information** building trust
15. **Support channels** for community engagement

The README should balance technical depth with accessibility, include visual elements to break up text, and provide everything a developer needs to understand, use, and contribute to the project. Do think deeper and harder all possibilities and things to include, then carefully plan how to lay out and create the document, before proceeding cautiously and carefully to create one. Be patient and meticulous about this task. You can use the reference README for your deep thinking and thorough exploration to carefully and meticulously plan and then create a complete validated comprehensive improved and re-imagined GitHub README based on your improved solution blueprint and PRD. Thank you once again, my most trusted AI assistant partner!

You are truly my awesome, deep-thinking assistant and partner! Now please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to deeply think and carefully plan how to create a complete and validated database schema file for PostgreSQL v16 within sql tags. Deeply and thoroughly explore how to create a comprehensive, production-ready PostgreSQL v16 database schema that serves as the robust foundation for the entire AI customer service agent system. This requires careful consideration of performance, scalability, security, and maintainability. This is a very critical centerpiece of the whole project because the coding revolves around it so you need to be very systematic and meticulous to carefully plan and create it for me. You can use the reference schema sql file below for your deep thinking and thorough exploration to carefully and meticulously plan and then create a complete validated comprehensive improved and re-imagined database schema within sql tags based on your improved solution blueprint and PRD. Thank you once again, my most trusted deep-thinking AI assistant!

you have done an absolutely awesome job so far! now please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to think deeply and harder and carefully and thoroughly explore how to plan and then create a detailed comprehensive validated coding execution plan for a AI coding agent to build out the complete project codebase in logical phases/stages. the phases should be able to be proceeded independently of each other. Break down the coding execution into manageable stages/phases and steps in each phase. For each step within each phase, specify a list of files to build, give a description of the purpose and interfaces for each file. add an integrated checklist for each step (within each phase) to help project manager verify the completion of each step. please take care to think deeply and plan meticulously to create a complete validated actionable execution plan to guide an AI coding agent to build out each correctly and accurately file by file, step by step and phase by phase. create a well-thought-out plan to ensure the success of the project codebase completion. you plan should comprehensive and detailed and accurate to ensure no ambiguity for any coding agent handling each phase independently. this execution plan is very important for the success of the project codebase so do be very careful and put in your due diligence to ensure successful completion of the whole project. thank you and good luck my very best coding assistant and partner!
