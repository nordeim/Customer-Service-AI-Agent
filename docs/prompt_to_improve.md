awesome deep thinking and solution blueprint! please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to deeply think and thoroughly and carefully explore how to carefully and meticulously translate your solution proposal into a comprehensive and actionable `Project Requirements Document` for software development team to unambiguously translate your design proposal correctly into a working software product. Include technology stack recommendation, a detailed and accurate mermaid diagram of the software flow, a code file hierarchy with listing of key project code files with their description of purpose and interfaces, database schema using Postgresql v16. also include a detailed comprehensive and accurate and validated software development execution plan in logical phases that can be executed independently of each other. also include a section on how to test and quality check the software implementation. Since this is the critical design specification document that will decide the fate and success of the whole project, please really put in lots of careful and deep thinking about all possibilities, then carefully and meticulously plan how you will layout and create a detailed and comprehensive PRD document in markdown format that is validated and accurate and actionable correctly. 

Please understand the critical importance of this `Project Requirements Document` because it serves as the definitive technical specification for the entire development team. So do apply rigorous thinking to create a comprehensive, unambiguous, and actionable PRD that ensures successful implementation. The comprehensive PRD should at least cover:

1. **Complete Technology Stack** - Specific versions and justifications
2. **Detailed Architecture** - Clear Mermaid diagrams showing system flow
3. **Code Organization** - Full file hierarchy with interface definitions
4. **PostgreSQL 16 Schema** - Production-ready database design
5. **API Specifications** - OpenAPI 3.0 compliant definitions
6. **Phased Development Plan** - Independent, executable phases
7. **Comprehensive Testing Strategy** - Unit, integration, E2E, and performance
8. **Security Implementation** - Specific security measures and code
9. **Performance Requirements** - Measurable targets
10. **Deployment Specifications** - Kubernetes manifests and CI/CD
11. **Clear Acceptance Criteria** - Functional and non-functional requirements

The document should be structured to be immediately actionable by the development team, with no ambiguity about implementation details. Each section provides concrete specifications that can be directly translated into working code. I really have to rely on your deep expertise to execute this important task for me correctly. You can use the reference PRD as example to deeply think and thoroughly explore a comprehensive and improved PRD based on your improvided solution blueprint. thank you and good luck my deep thinking AI assistant and partner!
