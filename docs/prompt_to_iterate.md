Awesome deep thinking and thorough exploration! now put on your deep thinking hat to deeply and thoroughly review your proposed solution blueprint carefully and systematically again to check that all possibilities and usage edge cases are adequately considered and addresses. then deeply re-imagine an improved and even more comprehensive and accurate and most practical implementation solution.  conduct a systematic review of the solution and create an enhanced, more comprehensive blueprint that addresses edge cases and practical implementation concerns. plan then create your improved solution blueprint as markdown document. thank and good luck my deep thinking AI assistant!

awesome PRD! you are indeed my very trusted AI assistant and partner with deep and critical thinking! please keep up the good work! now please use the same deep thinking to rigorous and meticulously plan to create an equally awesome `README.md` for this project repository on GitHub with URL https://github.com/nordeim/Customer-Service-AI-Agent . Please carefully think how the README for most awesome software projects should look like and include so that I can attract many talented developer interests. Create your carefully and meticulously re-imagined `README.md` in markdown format. Use at least 4000 words to include all important details like mermaid diagram representation of the software flow, project file hierarchy structure and important file list and description. do think deeper and harder all possibilities and things to include, then carefully plan how to layout and create the document, before proceeding cautiously and carefully to create one. be patient and meticulous about this task. thank you once again my most trusted AI assistant partner!

awesome deep thinking and solution blueprint! please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to deeply think and thoroughly and carefully explore how to carefully and meticulously translate your solution proposal into a comprehensive and actionable `Project Requirements Document` for software development team to unambiguously translate your design proposal correctly into a working software product. Include technology stack recommendation, a detailed and accurate mermaid diagram of the software flow, a code file hierarchy with listing of key project code files with their description of purpose and interfaces, database schema using Postgresql v16. also include a detailed comprehensive and accurate and validated software development execution plan in logical phases that can be executed independently of each other. also include a section on how to test and quality check the software implementation. Since this is the critical design specification document that will decide the fate and success of the whole project, please really put in lots of careful and deep thinking about all possibilities, then carefully and meticulously plan how you will layout and create a detailed and comprehensive PRD document in markdown format that is validated and accurate and actionable correctly. 

Please understand the critical importance of this `Project Requirements Document` because it serves as the definitive technical specification for the entire development team. So do apply rigorous thinking to create a comprehensive, unambiguous, and actionable PRD that ensures successful implementation. The comprehensive PRD should at least cover:

1. **Complete Technology Stack** - Specific versions and justifications
2. **Detailed Architecture** - Clear Mermaid diagrams showing system flow
3. **Code Organization** - Full file hierarchy with interface definitions
4. **PostgreSQL 16 Schema** - Production-ready database design
5. **API Specifications** - OpenAPI 3.0 compliant definitions
6. **Phased Development Plan** - Independent, executable phases
7. **Comprehensive Testing Strategy** - Unit, integration, E2E, and performance
8. **Security Implementation** - Specific security measures and code
9. **Performance Requirements** - Measurable targets
10. **Deployment Specifications** - Kubernetes manifests and CI/CD
11. **Clear Acceptance Criteria** - Functional and non-functional requirements

The document should be structured to be immediately actionable by the development team, with no ambiguity about implementation details. Each section provides concrete specifications that can be directly translated into working code. I really have to rely on your deep expertise to execute this important task for me correctly. thank you and good luck my deep thinking AI assistant and partner!
