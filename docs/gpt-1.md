Below is a concise, evidence-based comprehension report and an actionable remediation + delivery plan based on the attached artifacts (CLAUDE.md, database schema v4.sql, Solution Blueprint v4, PRD v4). No internal chain-of-thought is shown.

Summary of understanding

Mission: Build a Salesforce-native, enterprise-grade AI Customer Service Agent to autonomously resolve ≥85% of support interactions with P99 ≤500ms (goal ≤300ms), 99.99% uptime, and CSAT ≥4.5.
Tech stack: Python 3.11 + FastAPI, async runtime (uvloop), PostgreSQL 16 with pgvector, Redis, Pinecone, Elasticsearch, Neo4j, Kafka, Kubernetes, Istio, Kong, Vault, Prometheus/Grafana, ELK, Datadog.
AI stack: Multi-provider LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo primary, Anthropic Claude secondary), local fallback (CodeLlama), NLP pipeline (intent/sentiment/emotion/NER), embeddings (OpenAI text-embedding-3-large).
Data model: Extensive multi-tenant schema with RLS, partitioned high-volume tables (messages, audit), AI observability tables, knowledge entries with vector fields and ivfflat indexes.
Product/PRD requirements: Multi-channel (Web/Mobile/Email/Slack/Teams/API), Salesforce-specific features (Apex analyzer, SOQL optimizer, Omni-Channel), accessibility/i18n, compliance modules (HIPAA/PCI/FedRAMP), test coverage ≥85%, performance (1k RPS, 50k concurrent), DR (RTO 15m, RPO 5m).
Current implementation state (per CLAUDE.md): ~78% complete; Phases 1–5 largely implemented; Conversation engine ~85% complete; testing coverage ~65% with emotion-detection tests failing; no disaster recovery evidence; no load-testing evidence.
Critical gaps (prioritized)

Disaster Recovery — HIGH CRITICAL

Missing: RTO 15m, RPO 5m, multi-region/3-region deployment, cross-region backups/replication, DR runbooks and drills.
Business impact: Threatens SLA and uptime guarantees.
Test Coverage & Quality — HIGH

Current: ~65% coverage, 59 tests with failures (emotion detection misclassifying angry/frustrated → neutral).
Required: ≥85% coverage and green tests for confidence/gating.
Performance Validation — HIGH

Missing load/perf evidence: No Locust/Artillery/Cloud-based load tests for 1k RPS and concurrency targets; P99 validation incomplete outside test env.
Observability & Runbooks — MEDIUM

Need per-channel SLA tracking, SLOs wired to alerts, runbooks, and chaos tests.
Immediate (24–48h) remediation plan — goals: unblock CI gating, reduce ship risk

Task A: Add minimal DR spec & temporary runbook entry in repo (deadline: 24h)

Deliverable: DR README with RTO/RPO, backup schedule, restore steps, DB failover plan, contact list.
Verification: Document present + one restore smoke test on staging.
Task B: Stabilize failing tests & increase coverage (deadline: 48h)

Focus: Fix emotion-detection pipeline tests — reproduce locally, run failing test, inspect model mapping thresholds, add targeted unit mocks.
Commands:
pytest -q
coverage run -m pytest && coverage report --fail-under=85
Verification: All tests passing locally and coverage >=85% on CI.
Task C: Create perf smoke harness (deadline: 48h)

Add a small Locust/hey script that validates baseline latency & throughput (quick headless run).
Example run (headless):
locust -f tests/locustfile.py --headless -u 200 -r 50 -t 2m --host=http://localhost:8000
Verification: P50/P95/P99 snapshots stored in CI artifact.
Week 1 plan (deliverables & owners)

DR Implementation (SRE)

Implement automated hourly backups + WAL archiving; cross-region async replicas; scripted failover test.
Add k8s cluster failover / multi-region deployment manifests.
Success criteria: RTO ≤15m verified in tabletop test; RPO ≤5m demonstrated by WAL replay.
Tests & Quality (QA + ML)

Fix emotion model mapping: verify training data, thresholds, or fallback rules; add golden dataset and unit tests for emotion labels.
Expand tests to cover edge-cases across conversation engine and ai orchestrator.
Success criteria: CI shows ≥85% coverage and zero failing tests.
Load testing & capacity planning (SRE + Performance)

Implement Locust scenarios for 1000 RPS and synthetic 50k concurrency ramp (in stages); measure DB/redis/llm latency.
Baseline autoscale policies and circuit breaker thresholds.
Success criteria: P99 ≤500ms for core API in staging under target load or documented mitigation plan if not met.
2–4 week roadmap (stabilize → harden → GA readiness)

Multi-region deployment & DR automation (SRE) — cross-region replicas, automated failover, runbook automation.
Full performance testing and tuning (DB indexes, materialized view refresh cadence, caching strategies).
Accessibility & i18n acceptance (WCAG 2.1 AA tests, Flesch scores, RTL).
Security & compliance checks (SAST, DAST, SBOM, secrets, field-level encryption).
Complete evidence collection for CLAUDE.md claims: attach test results, load test artifacts, deployment manifests, and runbook signoffs.
Success metrics / verification checklist

Tests: unit+integration coverage ≥85%; all tests green in CI.
Performance: API P99 ≤500ms (goal ≤300ms); throughput 1k RPS in staging with monitoring graphs + artifacts.
DR: RTO ≤15m and RPO ≤5m validated by tabletop and one live failover test.
Reliability: Deployment manifests for multi-region + HA; alerts wired to PagerDuty.
Product: Emotion detection precision improved to meet test expectations; CSAT instrumentation present.
Minimal commands & CI checks (for immediate use)

Run tests + coverage:
Basic headless load test (adjust users/time to infra):
Quick DB backup (example):
Top risks and mitigations

AI misclassification (emotion/sentiment) → Mitigation: golden datasets, thresholding, deterministic rule-based overrides for high-risk labels, human-in-loop for low-confidence.
Performance bottlenecks underload → Mitigation: rate limiting, brownout strategies, caching, LLM request batching & timeouts, circuit breakers.
Data loss during failover → Mitigation: WAL shipping, cross-region replicas, automated tested restore, backup retention policy.
Recommended immediate owners (roles)

SRE/DevOps: DR, backups, multi-region deployment, load tests
QA/ML Engineer: failing emotion tests, golden datasets, unit/integration coverage
Backend Tech Lead: fix code defects surfaced by tests, instrument per-channel metrics
Product Owner: prioritize acceptance criteria, CSAT telemetry
Suggested next deliverable for me (pick one)

Produce a DR README + failover test checklist and a small k8s manifest for cross-region replicas; or
Investigate and propose a focused patch for emotion-detection tests (unit test and model threshold changes) with a small code diff.
If you confirm which deliverable you want first, I will produce the artifact (DR README or targeted code/test changes) and the exact files/changes to commit.
