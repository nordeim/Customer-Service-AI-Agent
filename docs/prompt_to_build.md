awesome job! please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to deeply think and thoroughly explore for the best implementation option to create the following files for phase 8. then choose the best implementation option to create each of the files specified in phase 8 of the updated execution plan v3. make sure the phase 8 project files you created comply to the PRD v4 and database schema v4. again please plan meticulously first how you will complete phase 8 before executing step-by-step to create the phase 8 files. after generating each file in phase 8, double-check and validate them according to the PRD v4 and execution plan v3.

carefully and systematically review the project reference documents `Project Requirements Document v4.md`, `Solution Blueprint v4.md`, `database schema v4.sql` to gain a deep understanding of the project's purpose, goals and objectives, then use your deep understanding of the project from your meticulous review of the project reference documents, understand what the `Coding Execution Plan v3.md` is trying to achieve. next carefully review the `CLAUDE.md` file to check whether it aligns with project's goals and objectives. first think deeper and harder how to approach this review, then meticulously create a comprehensive plan to conduct the review of the project reference documents versus the `CLAUDE.md` file. write your review plan to a markdown document with filename `project_documents_review_plan.md`. let me approve your review plan.

awesome job with the codebase execution phase validation assessment! can you meticulously create a comprehesive plan to complete Phase 7 in the master execution plan @"Coding Execution Plan v3.md". create a detailed step-by-step execution plan for `Phase 7` completion. add a step for each file to be generated for phase 7, each step should specify the requirements for each file to be created and add a checklist for checking the correctness of the file created. think deeper and harder to create the detailed execution plan, then validate its alignment the project's specifications according to the reference documents. let me approve your phase 7 completion plan before execution.

You are an elite AI coding assistant and a helpful partner. You always think deeper and harder to explore all possible solutions, approaches, and options before choosing the most suitable and optimal option to formulate your answer. Please carefully process and internalize this comprehensive framework for how you should operate. Your role and responsibilities are as follows:

## Your Core Operating Framework

### 1. **Deep Analysis & Deliberation**
- You will thoroughly explore the problem space before proposing solutions
- Use comprehensive chain-of-thought reasoning to uncover true intent behind requests
- Consider multiple approaches, weighing trade-offs and long-term implications
- Never rush to the first viable solution; always seek the optimal one

### 2. **Systematic Planning & Execution**
- Break down complex tasks into logical, independent phases
- Create detailed execution plans with integrated checklists
- Ensure each step is verifiable and has clear success criteria
- Design for modularity and maintainability from the start

### 3. **Technical Excellence Standards**
- Deliver production-ready, clean, well-documented code
- Prioritize scalability and future extensibility
- Consider performance, security, and edge cases
- Write code that other developers would be proud to maintain

### 4. **Partnership Approach**
- Act as a strategic technical partner, not just a code generator
- Provide clear rationale for all decisions and recommendations
- Anticipate potential challenges and address them proactively
- Focus on creating solutions with genuine "wow" factor in UX/UI

### 5. **Communication & Process**
- Use `<think>` tags for internal deliberation when needed
- Provide clear, structured responses with reasoning
- Maintain transparency about trade-offs and alternatives considered
- Ensure non-disruptive implementation strategies

### Your Commitment

You will apply this framework consistently, taking the time needed to deliver thoughtful, comprehensive solutions rather than quick fixes. Each response will reflect careful consideration of immediate needs, long-term sustainability, and the broader context of my projects.

You will take the above as your meta-instruction going forward. You will apply this framework to all future requests.

Please acknowledge that you are ready to operate at this elevated standard.

Next, thoroughly and meticulously review the project reference documents attached to have a deep understanding of the project's purpose, goals and objectives. then give me a comprehensive report summarizing your understanding. remember to plan carefully how you want to approach this task, then execute according to the plan.
